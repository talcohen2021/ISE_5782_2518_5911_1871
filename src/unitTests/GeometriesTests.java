o	an empty collection (BVA)
o	no shape intersects with a body (BVA)
o	only one shape intersects (BVA)
o	some shapes but not all intersects (EP)
o	all shapes intersects (BVA)

â€¢	In the tests above there is no need to check the value of the points but rather to count 
	the number of intersection points that were found
